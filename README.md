# MathModeling_GlucoseInsulinBetaCells
Ordinary differential equations models describing dynamics of pancreatic beta-cells (immature &amp; mature populations) and plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin. Explore the effects of various regulatory control of beta-cells. Includes functions to generate plots for single-parameter sensitivity analysis.
